# **Data Analysis Project: Data generated by a classmate**

## **Introduction**
This project aims to parse, plot and analyze data generated by a classmate. Test Driven Development approach will be applied to ensure at least 90% coverage in unit tests. The analysis results will be presented at the end of this document, including three generated graphs. 

### **Data Source**
Data generated by a classmate 
### **Public GitHub Repository**
The source code and related files for this project are available in the following GitHub repository: link to repository

## **Project Structure**
The project is organized as follows:

csv file : File containing downloaded data files from google drive folder 

data_parsing_and_plotting/: Folder containing the project's source code.

unitests/: Folder containing unit test files.


README.md: File containing detailed information about the project and how to execute it.

## **Project Description**

### Data Acquisition: Relevant data was downloaded from the google drive folder
### Exploratory Data Analysis: An exploratory analysis of the data was conducted to understand its structure and characteristics.
### Data Analysis: The data was processed and analyzed to identify significant trends and patterns.
### Graph Generation: Three graphs were created to visualize the analysis results.
### Results Presentation: Analysis to share the findings and conclusions from the graphs.
### Test Development: Test Driven Development approach was applied to write unit tests covering at least 90% of the code.

## About the data

I interpreted the data generated by the classmate as a database of 200,000 orders in a delivery application that connects the main fruit and vegetable suppliers in the city's marketplaces 
with local supermarkets. The database includes information such as the order identification number, the suppliers and their addresses, the customers and their addresses, the name of the 
transporter and their assistant, the quantity of items purchased in each order, the delivery fee, the order value, and other data



## **Generated Graphs**
### Graph 1: Transporter names 
![Transporter](https://github.com/juan-aguilera/Homework-6/assets/158538464/e1b46106-a33f-4ced-9d27-efc95e8d3332)

Analysis: 

In the 200,000 records, approximately 9,500 different transporter names were identified. The purpose of this graph and the following two is to display the histogram and to infer what type 
of distribution my classmate used to generate the data. In this case, it can be concluded that the data follows a normal distribution with a mean around zero.
A distribution of this type can be interpreted as indicating that there is a set of suppliers that are more preferred by local supermarkets for placing their orders, either due to proximity or quality.

### Graph 2: Quantity of items purchased in each order
![Total items ](https://github.com/juan-aguilera/Homework-6/assets/158538464/3cfcf99f-c87a-424f-801b-f56b43931a0b)

Analysis: 

The histogram representing the quantity of items purchased in each order appears to have a very random behavior. The distribution suggests that the data could have been generated randomly


### Graph 3: Delivery fee

Analysis: 

Before generating the histogram, I assumed that the distribution of the data representing the delivery cost would also be uniform, considering that the delivery cost depends on both the quantity of items and the distance. However, upon generating the graph, the distribution appears to be positively skewed, indicating that this cost is not entirely related to the quantity of items but rather to the distance. Additionally, it can be observed that the majority of deliveries are relatively short distances, with only a few exceeding the mean by a large margin.
