# **Data Analysis Project: Data generated by a classmate**

## **Introduction**
This project aims to parse, plot and analyze data generated by a classmate. Test Driven Development approach will be applied to ensure at least 90% coverage in unit tests. The analysis results will be presented at the end of this document, including three generated graphs. 

### **Data Source**
Data generated by a classmate 
### **Public GitHub Repository**
The source code and related files for this project are available in the following GitHub repository: link to repository

## **Project Structure**
The project is organized as follows:

csv file : File containing downloaded data files from google drive folder 

data_parsing_and_plotting/: Folder containing the project's source code.

unitests/: Folder containing unit test files.


README.md: File containing detailed information about the project and how to execute it.

## **Project Description**

### Data Acquisition: Relevant data was downloaded from the google drive folder
### Exploratory Data Analysis: An exploratory analysis of the data was conducted to understand its structure and characteristics.
### Data Analysis: The data was processed and analyzed to identify significant trends and patterns.
### Graph Generation: Three graphs were created to visualize the analysis results.
### Results Presentation: Analysis to share the findings and conclusions from the graphs.
### Test Development: Test Driven Development approach was applied to write unit tests covering at least 90% of the code.

## About the data

I interpreted the data generated by the classmate as a database of 200,000 orders in a delivery application that connects the main fruit and vegetable suppliers in the city's marketplaces 
with local supermarkets. The database includes information such as the order identification number, the suppliers and their addresses, the customers and their addresses, the name of the 
transporter and their assistant, the quantity of items purchased in each order, the delivery fee, the order value, and other data



## **Generated Graphs**
### Graph 1: Transporter names 
![Transporter](https://github.com/juan-aguilera/Homework-6/assets/158538464/e1b46106-a33f-4ced-9d27-efc95e8d3332)

Analysis: 
In the 200,000 records, approximately 9,500 different transporter names were identified. The purpose of this graph and the following two is to display the histogram and to infer what type 
of distribution my classmate used to generate the data. In this case, it can be concluded that the data follows a normal distribution with a mean around zero


### Graph 2: Quantity of items purchased in each order
![Total items ](https://github.com/juan-aguilera/Homework-6/assets/158538464/3cfcf99f-c87a-424f-801b-f56b43931a0b)
Analysis: Most countries have high levels of access to electricity, with some exceptions in specific regions. Just like in the previous graph, the most lagging region is 
Central and Southern Africa. Unlike the previous graph, the other regions have very high levels of electrification and are very close to each other on the graph, thus 
representing homogeneity in the data but leaving out the aforementioned region. Despite having a great natural resource for energy generation such as the sun, Central 
and Southern Africa remains a territory that requires large amounts of investment in various fronts.

### Graph 3: CO2 emissions (metric tons per capita) evolution (2014-2018) per Region
![Service value](https://github.com/juan-aguilera/Homework-6/assets/158538464/30f3a5e6-38be-4675-8556-721540759ea6)
Analysis: A downward trend in CO2 emissions per capita is observed in most regions, suggesting progress in mitigating climate change. However, it is important to analyze the relationship 
that this graph has with the previous ones. The regions with a better indicator of economic and social rights are the ones that generate more emissions. Additionally, 
despite regions like Latin America and the Caribbean having a high score and also a high electrification percentage, their emissions are very low compared to North America 
and the Middle East. This could indicate that their energy matrices are cleaner and their economies are not largely based on extractivism
